# 📊 Data Analysis Mastery: Beginner to Pro


## 🧱 STEP 1: Foundations of Data Analysis
### 1. Week 1–2: Introduction to Data & Analytical Thinking
What is data analysis?
Types of data: structured vs unstructured
#### 4 Types of Analysis:
- 🔍 Descriptive – What happened?
- 🧭 Diagnostic – Why did it happen?
- 🔮 Predictive – What might happen?
- 🧠 Prescriptive – What should we do about it?


Data analysis process: from question to insight
Roles: Analyst vs Scientist vs Engineer

### Week 3: Spreadsheets for Analysis (Excel/Google Sheets)
Data cleaning, sorting, and filtering → Descriptive

Functions & formulas ```(VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF, COUNTIF, etc.)```

Charts and pivot tables → Descriptive

## 💻 STEP 2: Programming for Data Analysis
### Week 4–5: Python for Data Analysis
- Variables, data types, loops, and functions
- Libraries: ``` pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn ```
- Importing & cleaning datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Data summaries, trends → Descriptive
- Anomaly detection → Diagnostic

### Week 6: SQL for Data Analysis
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINs → Descriptive
- Aggregations, subqueries → Diagnostic
- Hands-on querying from realistic databases

## 📐 STEP 3: Data Wrangling & Cleaning
### Week 7–8
- Handling missing data, duplicates → Descriptive
- Data transformation (reshaping, pivoting, merging)
- Working with datetime and categorical variables
- Diagnostic workflows: tracing the “why” behind data issues
- Real-life dirty dataset projects


## 📊 STEP 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Week 9–10
- Summary statistics → ```Descriptive```
- Visualizing distributions, trends, and outliers
- Correlation analysis → ```Diagnostic```
- Hands-on with ```seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly```

## 🧠 STEP 5: Data-Driven Storytelling
### Week 11
- Turning insights into narratives
