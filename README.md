# 📊 Data Analysis Mastery: Beginner to Pro


## 🧱 STEP 1: Foundations of Data Analysis
### 1. Week 1–2: Introduction to Data & Analytical Thinking
What is data analysis?
Types of data: structured vs unstructured
#### 4 Types of Analysis:
- 🔍 Descriptive – What happened?
- 🧭 Diagnostic – Why did it happen?
- 🔮 Predictive – What might happen?
- 🧠 Prescriptive – What should we do about it?


Data analysis process: from question to insight
Roles: Analyst vs Scientist vs Engineer

### Week 3: Spreadsheets for Analysis (Excel/Google Sheets)
Data cleaning, sorting, and filtering → Descriptive

Functions & formulas ```(VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF, COUNTIF, etc.)```

Charts and pivot tables → Descriptive

## 💻 STEP 2: Programming for Data Analysis
### Week 4–5: Python for Data Analysis
- Variables, data types, loops, and functions
- Libraries: ``` pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn ```
- Importing & cleaning datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Data summaries, trends → Descriptive
- Anomaly detection → Diagnostic

### Week 6: SQL for Data Analysis
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINs → Descriptive
- Aggregations, subqueries → Diagnostic
- Hands-on querying from realistic databases

## 📐 STEP 3: Data Wrangling & Cleaning
### Week 7–8
- Handling missing data, duplicates → Descriptive
- Data transformation (reshaping, pivoting, merging)
- Working with datetime and categorical variables
- Diagnostic workflows: tracing the “why” behind data issues
- Real-life dirty dataset projects


## 📊 STEP 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Week 9–10
- Summary statistics → ```Descriptive```
- Visualizing distributions, trends, and outliers
- Correlation analysis → ```Diagnostic```
- Hands-on with ```seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly```

## 🧠 STEP 5: Data-Driven Storytelling
### Week 11
- Turning insights into narratives
- Visual communication → ```Descriptive & Diagnostic```
- Building dashboards ```(Excel, Google Data Studio, Power BI)```

## 🧮 STEP 6: Statistics for Data Analysis
### Week 12–13
- Descriptive vs inferential statistics
- Probability distributions → ```Descriptive```
- Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals → Diagnostic
- Foundations for building predictive models

## 🧠 STEP 7: Introduction to Predictive Analytics
### Week 14–15
- Linear regression → ```Predictive```
- Classification basics ```(Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)```
- Model evaluation ```(accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)```
- Risk scoring, future event forecasting

## 📦 STEP 8: Real Projects & Portfolio Building
### Week 16–17
- Project 1: Sales trend analysis → Descriptive
- Project 2: Customer segmentation → Diagnostic
- Project 3: Predictive churn model → Predictive
(Optional advanced learners: Recommendation engine → Prescriptive)



## 🧰 BONUS MODULES (Optional Deep Dives)
- Power BI / Tableau Essentials → Descriptive & Diagnostic
- Web scraping with Python → Data sourcing for all types
- API Data Extraction → Data automation
- Using ChatGPT & AI tools → Prescriptive use of AI for suggestions & insight generation
